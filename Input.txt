Flex is a tool/computer program for generating lexical analyzers (scanners or lexers) 

    Written by Vern Paxson in C around 1987. Lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer 

And outputs source code implementing the lexer in the C programming language. The function yylex() is the main flex function which runs the Rule Section.
