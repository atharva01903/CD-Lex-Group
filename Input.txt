    flex is a tool/computer. program for generating lexical analyzers (scanners or lexers) 

    written by Vern Paxson in C around 1987. lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer.

and outputs source code implementing the lexer in the C programming

    language. The function yylex() is the main flex function which runs the Rule Section.
