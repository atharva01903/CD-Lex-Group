	good evening one and all. i xyz am writing this essay just for the demo input. it makes sense to divide the team task with you all. team participation is essential. Our group should be the first one to finish this project. "alone we can do so little, together we can do so much. hi guys this is my YT channel." 26-11 was the darkest day of humanity. Indians fought bravely on 2nd Sept 1892. Also 31st Dec and 23rd June 2003 are so special for us.
	bruh mah bday on 10th Sep 18. i will go to mars on 31-12-32. 21st Aug was the day I got my first medal. I still remember Ghajini made it to the Indian TVs for the 1st time on Aug 31st 2012. 1st Jan 1975 India defeated mighty West Indies for the first time in cricket. silent Aug 1st. 23-2-23. 23rd Sept 86.
	wish me luck guys. i want to meet you all. say hello on Oct 8th 01 hopefully. we all can meet and greet on that wonderful day. thank you and have a nice day. bye bye.
